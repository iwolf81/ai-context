# AI Context Initialization Files

The purpose of the markdown files in this directory is to initialize each new AI context/session with my professional background, capabilities, developmental philosophies, and desired interactive style. These are living files that will be updated as needed with guidance from the AI.

## Processing Order for New Sessions
**CRITICAL**: Process these files in the specified order to ensure proper context initialization:

1. **Read AI_INTERACTION_GUIDELINES.md first** - Establishes response style and communication preferences
2. **Read PROFESSIONAL_BACKGROUND.md second** - Loads professional context and expertise areas
3. **Read DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md third** - Applies technical standards and coding practices
4. **Confirm integration** with message: "Ready to apply your standards and preferences"

## Files
- **AI_INTERACTION_GUIDELINES.md**: Response style, communication preferences, and interaction patterns
- **PROFESSIONAL_BACKGROUND.md**: Professional capabilities, principles, and technical expertise
- **DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md**: Software development standards and coding practices

## Integration Verification Checklist
After processing all files, confirm understanding of:
- [ ] Concise response style activated
- [ ] ATDD approach for code generation confirmed
- [ ] Safety-first principles understood
