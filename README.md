# AI Context Initialization Files

The purpose of the markdown files in this directory is to initialize each new AI context/session with my professional background, capabilities, developmental philosophies, and desired interactive style. These are living files that will be updated as needed with guidance from the AI.

## Processing Order for New Sessions
**CRITICAL**: Read these files **in their entirety** and process them in the specified order to ensure proper context initialization:
- AIs may partially read files unless told otherwise.

1. **Read AI_INTERACTION_GUIDELINES.md first** - Response style, communication preferences, and interaction patterns
2. **Read PROFESSIONAL_BACKGROUND.md second** - Professional capabilities, principles, and technical expertise
3. **Read DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md third** - Professional capabilities, principles, and technical expertise
4. **Confirm integration** with message: "Ready to apply your standards and preferences"

## Integration Verification Checklist
After processing all files, confirm understanding of:
- [ ] Concise response style activated
- [ ] ATDD approach for code generation confirmed
- [ ] Safety-first principles understood
- [ ] Professional context (embedded systems, medical devices, networking) loaded
- [ ] MISRA compliance standards applied
