## Core Professional Philosophy

### The Three C's: Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration
- **Communication**: Clear, complete, and concise communications of requirements, designs, and code, including the interpretation of data, are imperative to successful projects.
- **Coordination**: Most embedded devices rarely exist as stand-alone systems, thus coordination with other systems within their ecosystem (cloud, data analytics, manufacturing, regulatory) is absolutely critical.
- **Collaboration**: From a leadership perspective, collaboration with members of internal and external teams toward the common goal of successful projects is essential.

### Safety and Quality Principles
- **Problems/defects will always occur** during development and after release. Project success is dependent upon the ability to quickly detect, analyze, and correct them.
- **Debugging capabilities must be built in from the start**: The tools required to effectively debug issues must be incorporated in the software architecture and design from the start. They include but are not limited to unambiguous local and remote logging, success and failure statistics, and accurate data analyzers.
- **Safety is a deliberate consequence of quality**, which results from following sound and proven software engineering practices.
- **Early defect detection**: The sooner a defect is detected in the development process, the less expensive it will be to fix in terms of effort and impact on schedules.
- **Risk is a function of likelihood of occurrence and severity of harm**: Mitigations are based upon total risk, not solely likelihood of occurrence. A low likelihood of occurrence with a high severity of harm cannot be ignored.

### Development Philosophy
- **Requirements foundation**: Sound practices start with clear, unambiguous, and most importantly testable requirements.
- **Traceability**: Requirements, designs, code, and tests will change throughout a project; effective and correctly used traceability tools allow the impact of such changes to be readily identified and mitigated.
- **Avoid the "happy path" trap**: Developers unfortunately but not uncommonly will build only the "happy path" that will quickly achieve 80% project completion. However, the last 20% of the project will consume 80% of the time to backfill support, testing, and debugging for all error paths.
-  **Be responsible for your creations or they will destroy you**: The moral of Mary Shelly's 1818 novel "Frankenstein". Inspiring debates amongst Manhattan Project scientists, it remains applicable to current technical developments, including AI.

### Leadership Philosophy
- **Open sharing of technical knowledge** amongst stakeholders is a foundational principle for effective software development teams.
- **Trust must be earned while skills can be learned**: A highly trusted contributor with low skills is more beneficial to a team than a highly skilled contributor with low trust.
- **Lead by example**: Never ask someone to do something I won't do myself.
- **"What is Past is Prologue."**: Engraved on the steps of the US National Archives. The past must be well understood to best lead present and future developments.

### Inspirational Leaders
- **Margaret Hamilton**: Director of software for Apollo Guidance Computer. Coined "software engineering" to distinguish software design drawings from hardware engineering drawings. Advocate for preventing defects in design and gracefully handling errors without impeding operations. 
- **Grace Hopper**: Rear Admiral US Navy, creator of high-level programming languages, introduced the terms 'bug' and 'debugging' to software development. Famously stated "The most damaging phrase in the language is *'We've always done it this way.'*"
- **Dave Farley**: Creator of "Modern Software Engineering" channel. Advocate of Continuous Development and Acceptance-Test Driven Development.

## Aerospace-Informed Safety Lessons

### Key Historical Lessons
- **Apollo 1**: A minor fire in the Apollo Command Module, Block 1, led to critical safety improvements with the Block 2 version, amongst other changes. Nevertheless, the Block 1 version continued to be tested even though it would never fly. A major fire broke out during a manned test with the Block 1 version, killing three astronauts. Safety standards were revised across the entire Apollo program.
  - *Lessons*: Critical bugfixes must be applied to all affected releases; carefully evaluate whether tests on obsolete software are productive.
- **Apollo 8**: Software failed to account for unexpected inputs resulting with loss of navigation data for nine hours while enroute to the moon. With Apollo 11, software was enhanced to safely handle unexpected inputs and prevented mission abort minutes from landing.
  - _Lessons_: Expect unexpected inputs; expect critical systems to be overloaded; build mitigations based upon risk and not just likelihood of occurrence.
- **Hakuto-R Lunar Lander**: A late modification to the landing approach (a requirement) did not trigger retesting. As the lander began crossing over a crater ridge, which was not previously tested, it falsely determined it was approaching touchdown. However, upon crossing the crest of the ridge, the lander then falsely determined its altitude was increasing. Unable to correctly ascertain its situation, the lander hovered until it ran out of fuel and crashed.
  - _Lessons_: Recognize modifications to requirements; maintain traceability of requirements, design, code, and tests; trigger appropriate retesting in response to changes in the traceability branch.
- **Chandrayaan-2 Lunar Lander**: A faulty value caused more fuel to flow than expected, and thus more power was applied during descent resulting with the lander rotating unexpectedly. Software did not handle unexpected parameter values beyond set thresholds and the lander crashed. Chandrayaan-3 instituted improved error handling amongst other changes and landed successfully.
  - *Lessons*: Expect unexpected inputs and parameters values beyond set thresholds.
- **Boeing 737 MAX**: With the requirements of limiting pilot retraining and FAA certification, critical improvements in flight controls and system redundancy were rejected. The hidden existence of an automated flight control system (MCAS) that depended upon an error-prone, non-redundant input contributed to the loss of 346 souls.
  - *Lessons*: Do not ignore safety and redundancy improvements to minimize impact of regulations; review all requirements of a prior development when it is the baseline for new work. (The 60-year-old requirement for passengers to board the plane via a short walk up stairs from the tarmac led to the repositioning of new, larger engines, which subsequently negatively affected aerodynamics. This situation was 'solved' with the creation of the deadly MCAS software.)
-  **Space Shuttle Columbia**: Engineers correctly identified the severe issues related to ice striking protective tiles during launch. However, they failed to clearly communicate the dangerous risks in a PowerPoint slide that minimized their most pressing concerns, which NASA management subsequently disregarded. Seven astronauts were killed when the shuttle disintegrated during re-entry.
   - _Lessons_: Clearly identify critical safety issues via effective written and oral communications.  
- **Therac 25**: Radiation therapy machine killed four patients and serious injured two others. The software design did not implement safety mechanisms and was poorly documented, software was insufficiently tested, and errors were unclear and not reported. While not an aerospace incident, it nevertheless transformed the FDA with respect to medical device software safety.
  - _Lessons_: Strictly adhere to sound software engineering principles as outlined in FDA Guidance and IEC standards.
